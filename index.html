    <h3>Sachin Tendulkar: Cricket Journey</h3>

    <p>In 1984, Sachin’s older brother, Ajit, saw his ability and encouraged him to play cricket. Sachin was taken to Ramakant Achrekar’s training centre at Shivaji Park, Dadar, Bombay, by his father. He was smitten with Sachin and recommended that he join Sharadashram Vidyamandir English Jr High in Dadar. Sachin enrolled at his aunt’s residence, which was nearer to the Dadar school. Ramakant Achrekar’s effort and mentoring shaped his career. 

        On December 11, 1988, Sachin scored 100 not out during a professional cricket match between Mumbai and Gujarat. He went on to play additional international and national cricket matches after that.
        
        He became the tournament’s leading run-scorer with 482 runs at an avg of 53.55 inside the 2011 World Cup win, and he couldn’t stop crying afterward. On December 5, 2012, Tendulkar was the first batter in history to reach 34,000 runs throughout all formats of cricket. 
        
        He appeared in around 657 international cricket matches. His long-awaited 100th century came against Bangladesh inside the Asia Cup on March 16, 2012. Sachin declared his retirement from ODI cricket on December 23, 2012. He has also declared that he will not participate in T20 Internationals. He played for the following major cricket teams: Indian Cricket Teams, A.C.C. Asian XI, Mumbai Cricket, Mumbai Indians, and Yorkshire Cricket teams.</p>
    <h3>Style of playing</h3>

        Tendulkar is a right-handed batter who also bowls off-spin, legged spin, and medium speed. Many new and unconventional strokes, like the paddle sweep and other types of scoop and slash, have been included in his batting approach. He has also led several teams in various formats, such as the Indian national squad.</p>
    <h3>Captaincy</h3>

 <p>Tendulkar also was captain of the Indian team, a position he held for two spells, neither of which was very successful. He took up the post in 1996, and the team’s performance over the next year and a half was extremely poor. He played Azharuddin as captain once more, but to little avail. Things eventually improved after Sourav Ganguly was appointed captain of the Indian side in 2000. It is claimed that captaincy added an unnecessary strain to Tendulkar’s career as a player and captain. Later, he captained the I.P.L. franchise Mumbai Indians and other exhibition teams.</p>
